# My Reflections on Lab1_intro

This notebook was my introduction to the PyTorch framework. It covers:

- Core functionalities of PyTorch and its role in deep learning.
- Building models using built-in layers and custom modules.
- Practical implementation of forward passes using object-oriented design.
- Understanding and applying backpropagation using `autograd` and updating parameters via `SGD`.

These exercises significantly improved my practical understanding of PyTorch internals and gave me confidence in customizing and training models from scratch.
